    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This classic lasagna is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family, and freezes well, too.</p>
    <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days. </p>
    <p>Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his college days. Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is posted here will easily serve eight people. </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes </li>
        <li>½ onion, chopped </li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.

        <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
